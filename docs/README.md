## OIDC Plugin Configuration Part üç≥

Before configure the OIDC plugin for the `inventory-service` we have to configure the Keycloak to get the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `keycloak introspection url`. To configure the Keycloak we will follow the following steps.

1. Go to the Keycloak admin panel.
2. Create a new realm. For example `stack-inventory`.
3. Create a new client. From the left side bar click on the `Clients` menu. Then click on the `Create Client` button. Give a `Client ID` for the client. For example `inventory-client`. This is your client_id that you will use later. Then click on the `Next` button.
4. Switch on the `Client authentication` button. Then select `Standard flow` and `Direct access grants` from the `Authorization flow` section. Then click on the `Next` button.
5. Give a `Valid redirect URIs` for the client. For example `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback`. You can configure it later as well. Then click on the `Save` button.
6. Click on the `Credentials` tab from your 'inventory-client' client. Then copy the `Client Secret` value. This is your `client_secret` that you will use later.
7. To create a user click on the `Users` menu from the left side bar. Then click on the `Add user` button. Give a `Username`, `Email` for the user. For example `inventory-user` and `user@example.com`. Then click on the `Create` button.
8. Set the `Password` for the user. Click on the `Credentails` form you `inventory-user`. Click on `Set Password` Button. Give you passowrd. Switch off the `Temporary` button. Then click on the `Save` button.

**Note :** you will find your `OpenID Endpoint Configuration` url from the `Realm Settings` menu. From the left side bar click on the `Realm Settings` menu. Then click on the `General` tab. You will find the `OpenID Endpoint Configuration` url from there. From the `OpenID Endpoint Configuration` url you will find the `introspection_endpoint` url. You will use this url as your `keycloak introspection url` later.

> We have done all the necessary configuration for the inventory and auth service. Now we will protect our `inventory-service` by configure the OIDC plugin for the Inventory service.

To configure the OIDC plugin for the `inventory-service` we will follow the following steps.

1. Click on `SERVICES` menu from the left side bar.
2. Click on the `inventory-service` service.
3. Click on the `Plugins` section.
4. Click on the `ADD PLUGIN` button.
5. Choose the plugin from `Other > Oidc`.
6. Give a config for the plugin. For example

```js
 consumer: "0a0b0c0d0e0f-0a0b0c0d0e0f", // you can give your consumer id. if you have no consumer then keep it blank. it will apply for all consumer.

 keycloak introspection url: "http://host.docker.internal:8081/realms/stack-inventory/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect"

client id: "inventory-client",

client secret: "2vlCXES0jmfbiOSiLDGx8GmXVE0zkgUk",
```

You can get the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `keycloak introspection url` from the keycloak admin panel. 

7. Click on the `ADD PLUGIN` button.

Now try to hit the inventory service url `http://localhost:8000/inventory`. You will get an error message `{"message":"Unauthorized. Invalid Token!"}`. Because you have not pass the `Bearar` token in the request header as `Authorization`. To pass the `Bearar` token in the request header as `Authorization` you have to follow the following steps.

First of all you have to login a user to the keycloak to get the `access_token`. As you remember we have created our `inventory-client` and gave `Stander flow` and `Direct access grants` from the `Authorization flow` section. To get the `access_token` you can choose either `password` or `authorization_code` grant flow. For simplicity we will use the `password` grant flow. But you can also mimic the `authorization_code` flow from the postman. We will talk about it later. Now we will use the `password` flow. To get the `access_token` we will follow the following steps. 

1. Open the postman and send a `POST` request to the auth service url `http://localhost:8000/auth/realms/stack-inventory/protocol/openid-connect/token`. 
2. Set the `Content-Type` header as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
3. Set the `Body` as `x-www-form-urlencoded`.
4. Send the following data in the body. as `x-www-form-urlencoded`.

```js
grant_type: "password",
client_id: "inventory-client",
client_secret: "2vlCXES0jmfbiOSiLDGx8GmXVE0zkgUk",
username: "inventory-user",
password: "your-user-password",
```
5. Send the request and you will get the `access_token` in the response body. Copy the `access_token` value.
6. Now send a `GET` request to the inventory service url `http://localhost:8000/inventory`. With the `Authorization` header as `Bearar` token. 
7. Now you will get the response from the inventory service üòç.


### üë®‚Äçüåæ Mimic the `authorization_code` flow from the postman
Now we will mimic the `authorization_code` flow from the postman. To mimic the `authorization_code` flow we will follow the following steps.

1. Open the postman and go to the `Authorization` tab from your collection settings.
2. Choose the `OAuth 2.0` from the `Type` dropdown.
3. Click on `Authorization using browser` button from the `Callback URL` section. and copy the `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback` url and go to the `inventory-client` from the keycloak admin panel. Then paste the `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback` url to the `Valid redirect URIs` section. Then click on the `Save` button.
4. Now come back to the postman and set 
 - Grant Type as `Authorization Code`

 - Auth URL as `http://host.docker.internal:8081/realms/stack-inventory/protocol/openid-connect/auth`

 - Access Token URL as `http://host.docker.internal:8081/realms/stack-inventory/protocol/openid-connect/token`

 - Client ID as `inventory-client`
 
 - Client Secret as `2vlCXES0jmfbiOSiLDGx8GmXVE0zkgUk`,

5. Click on `Get New Access Token` button. Then you will see a keycloak login page. Login with your user cradentials. Then you will see a popup window with the `access_token`. Copy the `access_token` value.
